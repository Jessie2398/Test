            <h3>Recently I have discovered the thrill of creating and designing webpages, so I thought "Why not 
                have some fun and make one about all the fun times Abby and I have had so far?". So, here we are! It's simple, but I wanted to do it anyways.

                Girl, you have no idea how much your friendship and your family's friendship means to me. I am so blessed and grateful that our paths got to cross.
            My only disappointment is that we don't live closer (Who knows, maybe someday that could change?). For now though, I figured maybe I could
        make a page that has a bunch of different pictures from all the times we got to hang out and have fun.
    <br>
    <br>
            It baffles me at how one of my best friends could be someone that I met online and even more, one that I have actually gotten to meet.
        Nothing could replace how special you are and all the times we have gotten to get together and have an absolute blast! Life is a funny thing for sure.
    I wouldn't trade those times for anything. You, your mom, and all of your family mean so much and are all such a blessing. Thank you for all that you 
    have done and been for me.
